Issues and Recommendations
Current Issues:
Disabled Tests: Some tests are disabled or skipped, which reduces test coverage
Prometheus Registration Issues: There appears to be a problem with Prometheus metrics registration in tests
Low Coverage in Critical Areas: Some critical components like the SMTP client and email batcher have no test coverage
Incomplete Handler Testing: Only the contact email handler is well-tested; other handlers have minimal or no coverage
Recommendations for Improvement:
Fix Prometheus Registration Issues:
Use separate registries for each test to avoid conflicts
Consider implementing a test-specific Prometheus metrics provider
Increase Coverage for Critical Components:
Add tests for the SMTP client with proper mocking of external dependencies
Implement tests for the email batcher functionality
Add tests for the aanmelding email handler
Improve Integration Testing:
Add more comprehensive integration tests that test the full email sending flow
Consider adding end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
Enhance Test Helpers:
Create more specialized test helpers for common testing scenarios
Implement better assertion helpers for email-specific validations
Test Edge Cases:
Add tests for error conditions and edge cases
Test rate limiting under high load conditions
Test template rendering with invalid or malformed data
Implement Benchmark Tests:
Add benchmark tests for performance-critical components
Test email batching performance under various conditions
Implementation Plan
To address these issues, I recommend the following implementation plan:
Short-term Fixes:
Fix the Prometheus registration issues in tests
Enable the disabled tests
Add basic tests for currently untested components
Medium-term Improvements:
Increase test coverage to at least 70% across all critical components
Implement more comprehensive integration tests
Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
Long-term Enhancements:
Implement benchmark tests for performance optimization
Add end-to-end tests for full user journeys
Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
